  WOODCOCK-JOHNSON IV TESTS OF ACHIEVEMENT FORM A AND EXTENDED QUALITATIVE OBSERVATIONS   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Letter-Word Identification: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately and identified more difficult items through increased application of phoneme-grapheme relationships (typical)
                                                                                          Applied Problems: Solved initial problems with no observed difficulty but demonstrated increasing difficulties solving the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Spelling: Spelled initial items easily and accurately; spelling of latter items reflected a need for further skill development (typical)
                                                                                          Passage Comprehension: Appeared to read initial passages easily but appeared to struggle as the reading increased in difficulty (typical)
                                                                                          Calculation: Solved initial problems quickly with no observed difficulties but demonstrated less automaticity with the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Word Attack: Identified nonwords rapidly and accurately with little effort (advanced phonic skills)
                                                                                          Oral Reading: Errors involving mispronunciation (2) and substitution (1) were observed
                                                                                          Math Facts Fluency: Solved problems at a rate typical for peers
