  Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement Form A and Extended Qualitative Observations   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Letter-Word Identification: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately but had difficulty applying phoneme-grapheme relationships to latter items
                                                                                          Applied Problems: Solved initial problems with no observed difficulty but demonstrated increasing difficulties solving the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Spelling: Spelled initial items easily and accurately; spelling of latter items reflected a need for further skill development (typical)
                                                                                          Calculation: Solved problems slowly and demonstrated less automaticity with the latter items
                                                                                          Word Attack: Identified the initial items rapidly and accurately but had difficulty applying phoneme-grapheme relationships to latter items
                                                                                          Oral Reading: Errors involving mispronunciation (13), hesitation (3), repetition (4) and transposition (1) were observed
