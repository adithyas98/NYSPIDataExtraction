  Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement Form A and Extended Qualitative Observations   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Letter-Word Identification: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately but had difficulty applying phoneme-grapheme relationships to latter items
                                                                                          Applied Problems: Solved initial problems with no observed difficulty but demonstrated increasing difficulties solving the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Spelling: Spelled initial items easily and accurately; spelling of latter items reflected a need for further skill development (typical)
                                                                                          Passage Comprehension: Appeared to read initial passages easily but appeared to struggle as the reading increased in difficulty (typical)
                                                                                          Word Attack: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately and identified more difficult items through increased application of phoneme-grapheme relationships (typical)
                                                                                          Oral Reading: Errors involving substitution (3) and repetition (3) were observed
