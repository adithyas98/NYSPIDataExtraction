  Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement Form A and Extended Qualitative Observations   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Letter-Word Identification: Identified words rapidly and accurately with little effort (automatic word identification skills)
                                                                                          Applied Problems: Solved initial problems with no observed difficulty but demonstrated increasing difficulties solving the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Spelling: Spelled initial items easily and accurately; spelling of latter items reflected a need for further skill development (typical)
                                                                                          Passage Comprehension: Appeared to read passages with no observed difficulties (good use of syntactic and semantic cues)

                                                                                          Word Attack: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately and identified more difficult items through increased application of phoneme-grapheme relationships (typical)
                                                                                          Oral Reading: Errors involving mispronunciation (3) and hesitation (1) were observed
