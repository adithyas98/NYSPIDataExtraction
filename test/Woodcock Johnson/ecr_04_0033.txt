  Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Achievement Form A and Extended Qualitative Observations   
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                                          Letter-Word Identification: Identified initial items rapidly and accurately and identified more difficult items through increased application of phoneme-grapheme relationships (typical)
                                                                                          Applied Problems: Solved initial problems with no observed difficulty but demonstrated increasing difficulties solving the latter items (typical)
                                                                                          Spelling: Spelled initial items easily and accurately; spelling of latter items reflected a need for further skill development (typical)
                                                                                          Passage Comprehension: Appeared to read passages very slowly and had difficulty identifying a correct word (struggled with application of syntactic and semantic cues)
                                                                                          Calculation: Worked very slowly and relied on use of strategies that appeared to be inefficient for age or grade level (nonautomatic)
                                                                                          Word Attack: Identified nonwords rapidly and accurately with little effort (advanced phonic skills)
                                                                                          Oral Reading: Errors involving mispronunciation (1), insertion (1) and repetition (2) were observed
                                                                                          Sentence Reading Fluency: Appeared to read sentences at a rate typical for peers
                                                                                          Math Facts Fluency: Solved problems quickly
